## Post-Install Configuration

Once the installation is completed, the following steps need to be executed in the Keycloak admin console within CX-Central realm:

1. Generate Client-Secrets for confidential clients and service accounts with access type 'confidential'.

2. Establish connection to the sharedidp instance

In order to enable the login of the initial user (see CX-Operator realm in sharedidp instance for username), the connection between the 'CX-Operator' identity provider of the centralidp instance and the according realm in the sharedidp instance needs to be established.
This is done by setting the 'example.org' placeholder in the CX-Operator' Identity Provider to the address of the sharedidp instance.

3. Setup SMTP configuration (Realm Settings --> Email)
